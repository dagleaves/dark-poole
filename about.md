[resume](http://dagleaves.github.io/assets/resume.pdf)

This is the personal blog of Daniel Gleaves. I am currently a sophomore computer science student at the University of South Carolina in Columbia, SC. I am interested in artificial intelligence research and have completed 1+ years of work with the Machine Learning and Evolution Laboratory at UofSC focusing on convolutional graph neural networks for material discovery. I am now working on continous learning neural networks.

Outside of academics, I enjoy fishkeeping, reading, programming, music (marching band - snare drum), fishing, weightlifting, and more! You will likely see projects related to many of these hobbies.

## Setup

If you are interested in setting up a similar website of your own, you can find my write-up [here](https://dagleaves.github.io/2022/01/11/setup-website)! 

The setup of the website is as follows:

- Built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)
- Hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
- Uses the [Dark Poole](https://github.com/andrewhwanpark/dark-poole) theme

Thanks for reading!
